            <p>
                My name is José Valadez. I’m 35 years old, father of three kids, all of them under 5 years old. I have
                been married for 8 years now and we currently live in Mexico. I like to play with my kids and to cook
                chocolate chip hotcakes on the 7<sup>th</sup> date of the week.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have 8 years of experience in the Material, Planning and Logistics area and I am currently working for
                a
                Canadian
                Company. I got myself into the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program because I want
                to make a transition into a different
                industry and<em> help others to sell their products and services online.</em> On top of that, I
                currently run a side photography hustle and I focus on portraits,
                private events and weddings.
            </p>
